# Querulous

WARNING!! THIS LANGUAGE IS JUST A TOY AND IS IN DEVELOPMENT.

It used to be 'Effulgent', but I thought 'Querulous' is a lot better because this is gonna be buggy.

## Syntax

### Print statement
Just a bit different with 'out'
```
start:
  printout "Hello World from Querulous"
```

### Comment
Yay! Just like Python.
```
# printout "This won't be printed out"
```

### Exit the program
Easy poosy.
```
start:
   printout "Weee!"
   stop
   printout "This does not show up."
```
